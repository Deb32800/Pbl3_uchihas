            <p>NavPark was developed to solve real-life parking issues in the urban areas of Hong Kong (Yau Tsim Mong district). Initially, we aimed to recommend routes and parking lots based on both traffic and availability. However, due to difficulties in obtaining historical traffic data, we decided to focus primarily on parking availability prediction, while relying on external APIs for routing.</p>
            <p>This requirements document reflects that shift in focus. It outlines how users will interact with the app, from viewing an interactive map and setting destinations, to receiving real-time updates and personalized parking suggestions. Our goal is to make the parking experience smoother and less time-consuming by providing relevant, up-to-date information in a user-friendly way.</p>
            <p>Through this document, we aim to provide a clear structure for how the app should function, based on the features we believe will most benefit users in a realistic and implementable way.</p>

            <p>The NavPark app is designed to enhance urban parking experiences by recommending parking lots based on real-time availability predictions rather than proximity alone. Instead of merely guiding users to the nearest lot, the app intelligently suggests the closest available parking space within walking distance of the user's destination. While routing is handled through external APIs to ensure reliability and efficiency, the core innovation of NavPark lies in its focus on predicting parking lot vacancy to reduce the time and stress associated with finding parking in congested urban areas.</p>

            <p>The app attempts to fix and mitigate several issues found around cities with a large population:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Allow users to find a parking lot easily in an overcrowded city</li>
                <li>Predicting parking lot availability to improve decision-making before and during a trip</li>
                <li>Minimizing unnecessary traffic caused by cars circling for parking</li>
