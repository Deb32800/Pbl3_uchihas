            <h5>1.1. Background</h5>
            <p>NavPark was developed to address real-world parking challenges in Hong Kong’s Yau Tsim Mong district. Originally, the app aimed to recommend parking based on both availability and traffic. Due to difficulties obtaining traffic data, we shifted focus to predicting parking lot availability, while using external APIs for routing.</p>
            <p>This requirements document outlines that revised scope, detailing how users interact with the app—from setting destinations and viewing parking options to receiving real-time suggestions. Our goal is to provide a user-friendly solution that simplifies parking through relevant, accurate, and actionable information.</p>

            <h6 class="section-title text-center">Abstract</h6>
            <p>NavPark enhances urban parking by predicting real-time lot availability near a user’s destination. Instead of guiding users to the nearest lot, it recommends available spaces within walking distance. Routing is handled via external APIs to ensure efficiency. The app’s key innovation lies in reducing parking time and stress through smart availability prediction, making it a practical solution for congested urban environments.</p>

                <li>Predicting parking lot availability to improve decision-making before and during a trip</li>

            <p>This use case diagram shows how users interact with the smart parking app, including registering, logging in, viewing the map, entering destinations, and receiving parking recommendations. It also includes adnimistrator functions like managing parking information as well as function for the government of Hong Kong such as updating the vacancy data. </p>

            <h6 class="section-title text-center">System Evolution</h6>
            <h5>Fundamental Assumptions:</h5>
            <p>This system assumes that reliable and up-to-date parking data can be accessed from external sources or APIs. It also relies on users granting location access and interacting with the app to input destinations. The current model operates under the assumption that users prioritize finding available parking spaces over simply reaching the nearest lot. It is also assumed that basic routing functionalities can be effectively outsourced to existing mapping services, allowing the project team to focus on vacancy prediction and UI/UX design.</p>

            <h5 class="mt-4">Anticipated Changes:</h5>
            <p>In the future, the system may evolve to incorporate historical traffic data once it becomes available, enabling better routing functions. As more data is collected, the accuracy of parking availability predictions can also improve through machine learning. If possible, the system may also adapt to other cities beyond Hong Kong, requiring adjustments in data sourcing and UI localization.</p>
